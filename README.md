A Linear Regression Approach to Housing Price Prediction.
Implementing a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
This project implements a linear regression model to predict house prices based on key factors like square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The data is loaded from a CSV file, preprocessed if necessary, and used to train and evaluate the model. The project explores the relationship between these features and house prices, providing insights into the real estate market.
The libraries used are::import pandas as pd
